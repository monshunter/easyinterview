description: "Review or fix code against spec/plan/checklist context. Use when the user wants L2 code review or remediation for already-implemented checklist phases. Reuses implement-owned shared context validator to resolve the target docs, then performs code review directly against the validated markdown and current codebase instead of running parser-heavy precheck scripts. Supports /plan-code-review <plan-name> [target] [--base-rev <git-rev>] [--fix]."

# Plan Code Review Skill

L2 code review for `code ↔ spec/plan/checklist`. This skill checks completed phases,
reports drift, and, when the user confirms fixes, routes remediation through
`/tdd --section`. It is not an end-to-end delivery entry point.

## Usage

- `/plan-code-review <plan-name>` - Review the default target of the named plan
- `/plan-code-review <plan-name> <target>` - Review a specific target
- `/plan-code-review <plan-name> [target] --base-rev <git-rev>` - Include git diff context
- `/plan-code-review <plan-name> [target] --fix` - Review, preview, confirm, and fix via `/tdd --section`
- `/plan-code-review <plan-name> [target] --fix --base-rev <git-rev>` - Same with git diff context
- `/plan-code-review -h` - Show help only
- `/plan-code-review -h -v` - Show verbose help (including workflow)

Flag rules:

- Plan name is mandatory
- `--fix` implies a review pass first
- Review is advisory; fix remains preview-only until user confirmation

## Shared Resources

Use the implement-owned shared resources:

- `.agent-skills/implement/shared/scripts/validate_context.py`
- `.agent-skills/implement/shared/references/plan-context-contract.md`

Reviewer rule:

- Trust the post-`doc-init` templates for markdown structure unless the user is
  explicitly fixing template drift.
- Do not add parser-only gates or markdown-format checkers before the semantic
  code review.
- New plan docs are sequential-only by default.
- Checked checklist items define the primary implementation scope.
- Phase `<!-- files: -->` metadata and task `**文件**:` declarations are optional
  hints, not required scope contracts.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Handle help flags

- `-h`/`--help`: show skill name, description, usage, then stop.
- `-h -v`/`--help --verbose`: show usage + full workflow, then stop.

### Step 1: Resolve plan and target

1. Require an explicit `plan-name`.
2. Read `docs/plan/{name}/context.yaml`.
3. Determine target from the explicit argument or `spec.defaultTarget`.
4. If target is missing, stop and show available targets.

### Step 2: Validate manifest and collect normalized file set

Run:

```bash
python3 .agent-skills/implement/shared/scripts/validate_context.py \
  --context docs/plan/{name}/context.yaml \
  --docs-root docs \
  --target {target}
```

Use the shared plan-context contract for role mapping and common errors.

Validation scope is limited to manifest shape/content and referenced markdown
paths. After validation, read the returned markdown files directly.

### Step 3: Determine code review scope

1. Main scope: checklist phases with at least one `[x]` item.
2. Gather concrete code scope from the strongest available sources, in this order:
   - `--base-rev` git diff filtered to files relevant to the current target
   - target-level discovery in `context.yaml` (`packages`, `uiRoutes`, `apiNames`, `commands`)
   - plan task declarations such as `**文件**:` or legacy `<!-- files: -->`
3. Missing phase file declarations do not invalidate the review by themselves.
4. If no concrete file set can be derived, fall back to target-level advisory review.
5. `--fix` requires a concrete checklist-section mapping; target-level-only findings stay preview-only until the user confirms the section.

Code scope sources:

- **Source A (git diff)**: if `--base-rev` is provided, `git diff --name-only {base}..HEAD`
- **Source B (context discovery)**: target `packages` plus other target discovery hints from validated `context.yaml`
- **Source C (plan declarations)**: `**文件**:` exact paths and legacy `<!-- files: -->` globs when present

### Step 4: Execute L2 semantic review directly

For each in-scope phase:

1. Read code files for the phase.
2. Read relevant spec sections.
3. Read plan task descriptions.
4. Read checklist items and completion status.
5. Merge git diff and target discovery context when present.

Review dimensions:

- `R-series`: consistency with spec definitions
- `P-series`: completeness against plan tasks and error handling
- `E-series`: best-practice code quality, tests, naming, security

Output rules:

- Each finding includes check ID, severity, description, and `file:line`.
- Cite the relevant spec/plan evidence.
- Distinguish drift from acceptable design-preserving extension.
- Put any extra findings under `Extended Findings` with `X-L2-*` IDs.

### Step 5: Branch by mode

**Review mode**:

1. Review all in-scope phases.
2. Aggregate the report.
3. If only target-level scope could be derived, say so explicitly.
4. Stop.

**Fix mode**:

1. Generate fix proposals with diff-style previews.
2. Explicitly degrade target-level-only findings to preview-only when no checklist section can be mapped automatically.
3. Wait for user confirmation.
4. For each accepted finding, map it to a checklist section.
5. Execute remediation only through `/tdd --section`.

### Step 6: Fix via `/tdd --section`

When the user accepts a fix proposal:

1. Map each accepted finding to a checklist section; unmappable findings stay preview-only.
2. If an item is incorrectly marked `[x]`, the preview must offer either:
   - reopen the item, or
   - append a remediation item
3. When a finding is supported only by target-level discovery or git diff, ask the user to confirm the checklist section before routing to `/tdd --section`.
4. Invoke:

```text
/tdd --file {checklist-path} --section {phase-prefix} --references {ref1},{ref2},...
```

5. After `/tdd` completes, run focused tests and adjacent/regression tests.
6. Verify compilation succeeds for affected packages.
7. Any test or compile failure means the fix is not applied.

## Guardrails

- Findings with no concrete checklist-section mapping are never auto-fixed.
- `/plan-code-review --fix` is remediation only; it does not own plan lifecycle sync or retrospective.
- Do not edit code directly outside the `/tdd` Red-Green-Refactor loop once fix mode is accepted.
